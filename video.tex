Theme of the video: 	The functionality that F# brings to the .NET development environment that C# and visual basic are lacking in

Ideas: 			- The idea that F# is primarily a functional language meant to fill in the lack of a functional language in the .NET environment.
       			- Also it's modern-day uses and the fields it is still relevant in

Code samples:		- Showing the basic functionality of the language, such as how compact data analysis algorithms can be.

Demo program:		- Will just compile and run the program and show what the results will be.

How to shoot it:	- Will be using OBS studio for screen/mic/webcam capture.
