http://fsprojects.github.io/ExcelFinancialFunctions/
Description: This is a .NET library that provides the full set of financial functions from Excel. It can be used from 
both F# and C# as well as from other .NET languages. The main goal for the library is compatibility with Excel, 
by providing the same functions, with the same behaviour.

Note though that this is not a wrapper over the Excel library; the functions have been re-implemented in managed code 
so that you do not need to have Excel installed to use this library.
