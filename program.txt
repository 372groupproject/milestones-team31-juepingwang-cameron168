  Our program will implement a HTML Parser that is able to create a UofA Computer Science department directory. This program will extract all peoples’ information from the following links:

      https://www.cs.arizona.edu/about/faculty
      https://www.cs.arizona.edu/about/staff
      https://www.cs.arizona.edu/about/graduate-students

  The program will have two main functionalities, data extraction and data cleaning. The input of the program will be the above three links that are defined as the global variables. The output will have two parts. First, the Console will display the number of faculties, staff and graduate students. Second, there is a csv file that will be create after the program finishes. The csv file contains all the peoples’ information that arranged by office floor. For each floor, the information will be sorted by the peoples’ first name. The information includes Name, Title, Office location, Interest, Phone Number and Email Address. In addition, the program has around 400 lines. 

  We think this program will be a good illustration of the features of our language. F# is a functional programming. Even we do not have a lot of package to use, such as Python, it has a friendly coding style and the features from OOP programming. The functional programming is very powerfully on data extraction because the syntax is easy, and the code is short. The OOP features help us deal with data cleaning. For example, the iteration will be much easier to implement and read in some cases.
