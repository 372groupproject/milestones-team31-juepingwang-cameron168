Our program will implement a program that will calculate the student grades 
and does analysis on the grade distribution.

We expect the program to have the computational functionality and analytical
functionality, such as graphs and statistical analysis. It will read the file,
and perform data clean. Then, we will do statistical analysis, such as
demonstration for distribution. Also, it will includes data data visualization.

We expect the program to be approximately 400 - 500 lines of code.

We think this program will be a good illustration of the features of our
language because F# has a lots of advantages on data analysis
